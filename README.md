# Machine learning_notebooks

This repository storeds machine learning projects using notebooks with python. It explores how to use traditional machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn and deep learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow.

In addition to that, try to cover the machine learning lifecycle going through steps like data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, training and testing models.
